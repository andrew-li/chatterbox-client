room1
  username1: "message"
  username1: "message"
  username2: "fsdfsdf"


room2
  username1: "message"
  username2: "fsdfsdf"


each room is a div
write username with colons and message
pad each username message



<div>
roomname
<s></s>
<s></s>
</div>

results

var roomList = {room1: [{username: "bob", message: "hi"}, {}, {}],
                room2: []
              }


the first time you see a name, put into a map
roomList[roomname] = [{username:, message:} , {}]
and also put its message into that roomList[roomname]

when we see a repeat, then push the username and message
